# Sophon

_A research hub for universities_

## Goal

The goal of this project is developing a platform that universities can use to **host** and **share** their _datasets_, _research projects_ and resulting 
_papers_.

## Development

The project consists of a **single-page-app with React** on the frontend and a **web API with Django Rest Framework** on the backend.

### Progress

Development progress is tracked on [issue #20](https://github.com/Steffo99/sophon/issues/20).

Development is currently focusing on the **backend**.

### Tools

Sophon is being developed using [IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/): its metadata is included in the `.idea` directory so that the code style and tools are consistent across all machines used during the development.

Run configurations for *running the backend*, *testing the backend* and *running the frontend* are included.
